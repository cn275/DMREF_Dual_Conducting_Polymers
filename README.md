# DMREF_Dual_Conducting_Polymers
A repository for codes developed under NSF's DMREF program Award number: 1629369. The codes developed here are tools to aid in the molecular simulation of materials.

Overall project description:
The project falls under the umbrella of Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) for Global Competitiveness sponsored by Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF). The primary goal is to develop and study organic materials that conduct both electronic and ionic charges for a wide range of applications including rechargeable batteries, electrochemical transistors, and bioelectronic devices. We couple organic substituents capable of electronic (polythiophenes) conductivity with ionic conductivity (poly(ethylene glycol) with ionic dopants) in self-organizing materials. We design, synthesize, assemble and characterize electronic-ionic conductors ranging from oligothiophene-oligo-ethylene glycol small molecules to macromolecules.
